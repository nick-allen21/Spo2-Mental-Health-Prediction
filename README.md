# Spo2-Mental-Health-Prediction
Over the past year, I have been part of Stanford's Snyder Lab aiding in their pursuit to predict mental health states via wearable technology. Using 718 participants, wearable data, and robust survey questionnaires, we have been using machine learning to predict a patients mental health state at a given point. I have primarily worked with SpO2.
